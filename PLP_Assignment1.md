## Introduction to C++
**Amal Saeed**


1. The name of the language I will learn is C++.

2. History of C++: In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup joined the Computing Science Research Center of AT&T Bell Laboratories. Influenced by the object-oriented language SIMULA, he began developing class extensions to C to write sophisticated, elegant as SIMULAR programs, with the efficiency of C. It was initially called C with Classes, and later changed to C++ in 1983. Stroustrup released a book two years later, but it wasn't until 1998 that the language was standardized. Many different compilers, including Turbo C++ have been released, and updated over the years.

3. It is primarily object-oriented. 

4. It is primarily compiled.  

5. C++ is primarily used in finance (high-performance applications), video games, high-performance embedded and real-time systems, transportation (traffic light signal systems), manufacture, and other industries where precision is important.

6. The top three most popular posts on GitHub when searching C++ include: 
      - cocos2d/cocos2d-x (cocos2d-x for C++) with 7,327 stars
      - facebook/folly (An open-source C++ library developed and used at Facebook.) with 6,071 stars             
      - openframeworks/openFrameworks (openFrameworks is a community-developed cross platform toolkit for creative coding in             C++.) with 4,089 stars

7. To learn and become proficient in C++, I will use *C++ Programming: For the Absolute Beginner* (2nd ed) by Michael Vine, this [C++ Tutorial website](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/lesson1.html), in addition to the C++ Essential Training by Bill Weinman, among many more videos, available on lynda.com.
